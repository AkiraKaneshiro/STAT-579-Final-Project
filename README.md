I think visualizing something to do with public transportation might be interesting. I would especially like to see how use of public taxis has been affected by the onset of Uber and Lyft, but it may not be possible to get any data from those companies. Even so, I think there may be enough data here for a solid project.

Also, it would be interesting to examine drug abuse in US metros. I have found datasets about drug-related hospital visits from 2004 to 2011. We could visualize trends in drug misuse across demographics and drug types over time. These large datasets have thousands of observations and more than 200 variables. It would take quite a bit of time to clean the data and identify variables of our interest.
