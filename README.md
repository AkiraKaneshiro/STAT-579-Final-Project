[Yelp academic dataset](https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset)

Currently examing ```business.csv``` dataset. 

>I have filtered the business dataset for restaurants only. I then seperated the restaurants into breakfast,
dinner, and lunch establishments. I have also cleaned up all of the variables that I thought will be useful.

I think there is a lot we can look at with the ```food.csv``` dataset, including ```bfast.csv```, ```lunch.csv```, and ```dinner.csv```. There is definitely a lot of information there. What I am wondering is what we can do with the other datasets, such as ```User.csv``` and ```tip.csv```. I'm not sure that we will be able to do anthing interesting with them in terms of the scope of this project.
